## ‚úÖ 2. Session History & Analytics

### What It Does
Comprehensive session tracking system that records and analyzes your brainwave training sessions over time.

### Key Features

#### **Recording Controls**
- **Start/Stop Recording** button
- Live duration counter while recording
- Visual "REC" indicator in header
- Automatic data capture every data point

#### **Session Summary Statistics**
- **Total Sessions**: Lifetime session count
- **Total Time**: Cumulative training time
- **This Week**: Time spent training in the last 7 days
- **Favorite State**: Most common dominant brainwave band

#### **Session List**
Each saved session shows:
- Date and time
- Duration
- Dominant brainwave band
- Visual time distribution bar
- Notes (if added)
- Quick delete option

#### **Detailed Session View**
Click any session to see:
- Full statistics breakdown
- Time spent in each band (percentage + duration)
- Visual progress bars per band
- Add/edit notes about the session
- Exact start time and total duration

#### **Data Management**
- **Export to JSON**: Download all session data
- **Clear All**: Remove all sessions (with confirmation)
- **Add Notes**: Journal your experience for each session
- **Auto-save**: Everything stored in browser LocalStorage

### How Session Tracking Works

1. **Start Recording**: Click "Start Recording Session" button
2. **Training**: App automatically tracks:
   - Time spent in each brainwave band
   - Average power levels per band
   - Dominant state throughout session
3. **Stop Recording**: Click "Stop Recording" to save
4. **Review**: View your session immediately or anytime in history

### Session Data Tracked

For each session:
```typescript
{
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date,
  duration: number (seconds),
  dominantBand: string,
  bandStats: {
    delta: { totalTime, percentage, averagePower },
    theta: { totalTime, percentage, averagePower },
    alpha: { totalTime, percentage, averagePower },
    beta: { totalTime, percentage, averagePower },
    gamma: { totalTime, percentage, averagePower }
  },
  notes: string (optional)
}
```

### Storage
- Maximum 100 sessions stored (automatically maintains limit)
- Stored in browser LocalStorage
- Can be exported as JSON for backup/analysis
- Data persists across browser sessions

## üéØ How to Use

### Waveform Display
- **Just watch it!** No interaction needed
- The waveform scrolls automatically left-to-right
- Color changes match your current brain state
- Check the FPS counter to ensure smooth performance

### Session Tracking

**Quick Start:**
1. Open the app
2. Click the **chart icon** (üìä) in the header to go to Session History
3. Click **"Start Recording Session"**
4. Return to dashboard (back arrow)
5. Train/meditate/focus as normal
6. Return to Session History
7. Click **"Stop Recording"**
8. View your results!

**Best Practices:**
- Start recording at the beginning of your session
- Keep the app open and connected to data
- Add notes immediately after for best recall
- Review trends weekly to see progress
