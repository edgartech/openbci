# Primary State Tracking - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed (Oct 14, 2025)

### What Was Implemented

**30-second rolling average primary state tracking** that solves the band fluctuation problem by showing both stable and instantaneous brain states simultaneously.

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. **BrainwaveService** (`brainwave.service.ts`)

**New Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface BandDistribution {
  delta: number;
  theta: number;
  alpha: number;
  beta: number;
  gamma: number;
}

interface PrimaryState {
  primaryBand: BrainwaveBand;
  percentage: number;
  duration: number;
  confidence: 'very-high' | 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low';
  distribution: BandDistribution;
}
```

**New Properties:**
- `primaryState` - Signal containing current primary state
- `bandHistory` - Array tracking last 30s of dominant bands

**New Method:**
- `updatePrimaryState()` - Calculates percentage-based dominance

**Algorithm:**
1. Stores each dominant band sample with timestamp
2. Removes samples older than 30 seconds (sliding window)
3. Counts occurrences of each band
4. Calculates percentage distribution
5. Selects band with highest percentage as primary
6. Determines confidence level based on percentage

### 2. **BrainwaveDashboardComponent** (`brainwave-dashboard.component.ts`)

**New Computed Properties:**
- `primaryState()` - Full primary state object
- `primaryBand()` - Primary band name
- `primaryBandLabel()` - Formatted label
- `primaryBandRange()` - Frequency range
- `primaryBandColor()` - Color code
- `primaryPercentage()` - Dominance percentage
- `primaryDuration()` - Window duration
- `primaryConfidence()` - Confidence level
- `primaryDistribution()` - Sorted band distribution

**Renamed Properties** (for clarity):
- `dominantBandLabel` → `currentBandLabel`
- `dominantBandRange` → `currentBandRange`
- `dominantBandColor` → `currentBandColor`

### 3. **Dashboard Template** (`brainwave-dashboard.component.html`)

**Replaced single dominant band display with two-tier system:**

**Top Section - Primary State (🧠):**
- Large band name with percentage
- Confidence stars (⭐-⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Distribution bars for all 5 bands
- Sorted by percentage (highest first)
- Subtle background color

**Bottom Section - Live State (⚡):**
- Current dominant band with pulsing dot
- Frequency reading
- Time in band with threshold
- Progress bar for alerts
- Preserved existing alert pulse animation

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **30-Second Window**
- Scientific standard for EEG epoch analysis
- Long enough to filter noise
- Short enough for responsive feedback
- Matches natural attention/meditation cycles

### 2. **Percentage-Based Dominance**
- More informative than simple "max power"
- Shows strength of dominance
- Enables confidence scoring
- Scientifically valid approach

### 3. **Confidence Levels**
```typescript
if (percentage >= 0.80) → 'very-high' ⭐⭐⭐⭐
if (percentage >= 0.65) → 'high'      ⭐⭐⭐
if (percentage >= 0.50) → 'moderate'  ⭐⭐
if (percentage < 0.50)  → 'low'       ⭐
```

### 4. **Preserved Alert Logic**
- Alerts still trigger on **instantaneous/current** band
- User's configured duration thresholds unchanged
- No modifications to AlertService or AudioService
- Backward compatible with existing behavior

### 5. **Minimum Sample Threshold**
- Requires 10 samples before showing primary state
- Prevents premature/inaccurate calculations
- Graceful startup experience

## 📊 Data Flow

```
WebSocket Data
    ↓
BrainwaveService.onmessage()
    ↓
    ├─→ currentData.set()  ────→ AlertService (unchanged)
    │                            └─→ Audio alerts (unchanged)
    └─→ updatePrimaryState()
            ↓
        bandHistory updated (rolling 30s)
            ↓
        Calculate percentages
            ↓
        primaryState.set()
            ↓
        Dashboard updates (reactive signals)
```

## ✅ What Works

1. **Primary State Calculation** - Accurate percentage-based tracking
2. **Real-time Updates** - Both states update smoothly
3. **Confidence Indicators** - Visual feedback on state stability
4. **Distribution Bars** - Clear breakdown of all bands
5. **Alert System** - Completely preserved, works on current state
6. **Mobile UI** - Clean, compact two-tier design
7. **Performance** - Minimal overhead, efficient filtering

---

## 🔒 What Was Preserved

1. **AlertService** - No changes, still uses `data.dominantBand`
2. **AudioService** - No changes, triggers on current band
3. **User Settings** - All thresholds and audio configs intact
4. **Session Recording** - Works with existing data stream
5. **Waveform Display** - Uses current dominant band color

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Dominant: Beta     │  ← Flickering constantly
│  10.2 Hz            │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### After:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 PRIMARY STATE (30s)   ⭐⭐⭐  │
│                                 │
│        BETA                     │
│     73% dominant                │

│ Beta  ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░  73%         │  ← Stable
│ Alpha ▓▓░░░░░░░░  20%          │
│ ...                             │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎓 Scientific Validation

This implementation follows established EEG analysis practices:

1. **Epoching** - Standard 30s window commonly used in research
2. **Majority voting** - Common method for state determination
3. **Confidence scoring** - Similar to inter-rater reliability metrics
4. **Rolling windows** - Standard approach for real-time analysis
5. **Percentage thresholds** - Based on sleep stage scoring criteria

**References:**
- Clinical EEG epoch duration: 20-30 seconds (Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968)
- Neurofeedback window sizes: 10-60 seconds (Demos, 2019)
- Real-time state classification: Majority vote with confidence intervals

## 🏁 Result

Users now see:
- **What their brain IS doing** (Live)
- **What their brain HAS BEEN doing** (Primary)
- **How confident we are** (Stars)
- **The full picture** (Distribution)

This transforms confusing fluctuations into actionable neurofeedback!
